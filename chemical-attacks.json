According to media articles from the Times of Israel (https://www.timesofisrael.com/syrian-activists-report-new-chlorine-attacks-in-idlib/), ibtimes, newsweek, and human rights watch they reported that provinces in Idlib throughout the battle held in the Northwestern Syria province, chemical attacks had occured and to add the geopolitical element to these attacks, many of these attacks according to Al Jazeera, between the months of April-June 2015, the Assad regime has continously bombarded rebel held areas to weaken their offense and while at the same time, has used chemical weapons in different provinces in the city of Jisr al-Shugour which included, Al-Janudiyah, Al-Bashiriya, and Al-Sarmaniya. These attacks occured around the same days in the month of May 2015 in the city of Jisr al-Shughour. The chemicals were put into multiple barrel bombs that were dropped in multiple villages as mentioned in the beginning. According to the article published by the Times of Israel, 80 people were injured in the attacks which included children who were killed as well as elderly Syrians. Many of the images and documents that conclude these reports were mentioned in the articles by human rights activits on the ground which included images of the weapon and destruction of the cities. Overall, we can infer that the chemical weapons attack was lanuched allegeldly by the Syrian regime throughout the battle between the rebels and government forces in Idilib.

Bombings in Bustan Al-Qasr started on December 8th, 2016. The victims of the bombardment in Bustan included children, women, and in general many were inncocent civillans.  The purpose of the attack by the Syrian government was try to take over Aleppo to gain territorial control back to the Syrian government. Acorrding to a report from the New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/world/middleeast/syria-aleppo-united-nations.html) , many had been imprisoned, tortured, and bodies lying on the street from constant bombardment by the regime. Furthermore, some of the innocent civillans throughout the conflict between the government and rebel forces had either reported that the rebels would prohibt civilains from leaving the city and some stated that they actually allowed civillians to flee. According to a report from the Gaurdian (https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/dec/13/eastern-aleppo-as-pro-assad-forces-move-in-in-pictures), they have documented multiple images of Syrians from Aleppo which includes the city of Bustan Al-Qasr, showing women and children fleeing from their homes due to constant clashes between the syrian and rebel forces. Thus, we can assume that the constant bombardment that was perputrated by the syrian regime has forced many to flee from their homes, displacing them and as to the reports that were mentioned, many innocent civillans were killed, imprisoned, tortured, etc. by the syrian forces.",

This neighboorhood had a strong ISIS hold as well so many of the locals stated that they weren't allowed to document the chemical attacks because of fear from the Islamic State.

Going back to the Human Rights Watch report, 67 locals died from the chemical attacks and these were noted by medical charity workers on the ground, on ground activists, etc. Furthermore, reports by the Human rights watch and well established media reports collected on the chemical attack in Eastern Hama conclude that the attacks were allgedly done by the syrian and russian regime in order to combat the Islamic State that has a strong hold in eastern Hama even though many pf the attacks had harmed numerous innocent civillians.",

According to the Human Rights Watch report (https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/05/01/death-chemicals/syrian-governments-widespread-and-systematic-use-chemical-weapons), they recieved information from the locals of the neighboorhood reporting that there were war planes dropping the chemical weapons and that ot was done by the syrian and russian regime. This neighboorhood had a strong ISIS hold as well so many of the locals stated that they weren't allowed to document the chemical attacks because of fear from the Islamic State. According to Al Arabi's report (https://www.alaraby.co.uk/politics/2016/12/12/%D9%82%D8%AA%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%88%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%A8%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%81-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%82%D9%8A) they reported that many civillians in neighborhoods of East Hama suffucated because of the chemical weapons which were linked to be Sarin gas according to the media report. Going back to the Human Rights Watch report, 67 locals died from the chemical attacks and these were noted by medical charity workers on the ground, on ground activists, etc. Furthermore, reports by the Human rights watch and well established media reports collected on the chemical attack in Eastern Hama conclude that the attacks were allgedly done by the syrian and russian regime in order to combat the Islamic State that has a strong hold in eastern Hama even though many pf the attacks had harmed numerous innocent civillians.
